# Learning Assembly with Fasm and Raylib

Welcome to my journey of learning assembly language! This project demonstrates how to use Fasm (Flat Assembler) to link external libraries,
and I've chosen to integrate it with Raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library for graphical applications.

## Why Assembly and Fasm?

Assembly language provides a low-level, close-to-hardware programming experience which is incredibly powerful for understanding the inner workings of computers.
Flat Assembler (Fasm) is a fast and efficient assembler that allows for easy linking with external libraries,
making it a great tool for learning and experimenting with assembly language.

## My Discovery Process

A big shoutout to [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily), an incredible programmer on YouTube,
whose videos inspired me to explore the possibilities of integrating external libraries with assembly language! ðŸ’¡
